# BeanScene Reservation Website

Final Project for Diploma of Information Technology (Advanced Programming) at TAFE NSW.

This project was created by **Jorge Palma, Tom Neil and Shota Hirokawa** for BeanScene. The project seeks to modernise BeanScene Reservation's system by creating a website that allows staff and managers to CRUD Reservations while also allowing Guests to Create Reservations.

Inside this project you can find the Website created using .NET (C#, MVC, Entity Framework) and Bootstrap. Additionally, you can find a simple REST API used for BeanScene Mobile App and Data Entry using C# with MongoDB

## Functionality of the Website:
* Create Reservations
* Edit Reservations
* Update Reservations
* Delete Reservations
* Create Sittings (by Date, Time and Menu options)
